I can still recall the black-bordered head of three Mickey Mouses in the artwork created by Prem's father, my school best friend, 14 years ago. Yet ask me about the API status codes I studied just yesterday, and it's like trying to grasp smoke.

It's crazy to realize that we all remember experiences, but not numbers.

So, why not transform these status codes into a memorable story?

A mysterious 506 status code would make my head tilt up, wondering what it means, and my brain responds with a baffling 404.

[Cheatsheets](https://www.restapitutorial.com/httpstatuscodes.html) are handy, but we can't invest to sneak them now and then. Let's end our struggles together by learning a story and ensure you never get that '404 brain error'

### **A deliciously simple story!**

Think of it as dining at your favourite restaurant, the "HTTP Restaurant Express."

**HTTP:** You might have seen those three-letter and three-digit codes when working with websites and APIs. They can seem intimidating at first, but let's simplify things.

### **1xx Informational - The Welcoming Lobby**

Picture yourself entering a fancy restaurant. The moment you walk in, you're greeted with a warm smile and a friendly host. This is like the "1xx Informational" code. It's there to provide initial information, like letting you know about the day's specials and giving you a heads-up about wait times.

In general, 1xx says something like, "Request received, continuing process"

Just a heads up, you are the client, the restaurant is the server, and the waiter is an API.

### **2xx Successful - A Delightful Dining Experience**

Once you're seated at your cosy table, the magic begins. The waiter takes your order, and soon enough, a delicious meal arrives.

You say "1 Pizza"

**waiter — OK**

then, "burger with french fries"

**— OK**

a mojito

**— OK**

You request him to serve an item. He accepts it by saying OK. This is just like the "2xx Successful" code. It means everything is going well, and you're getting what you asked for.

### **3xx Redirection - The Waiter's Gesture**

Now, imagine you've enjoyed your main course, but as you contemplate the dessert menu, you request a piece of mango cool cake.

For some reason, the waiter approaches and kindly suggests, 'Sir, how about trying this Italian mango cool cake instead?' This thoughtful gesture mirrors the '3xx Redirection' code as you smoothly transition to something equally delightful.

The client (you, in our case) must take additional action to complete the request.

More redirections can cause [network traffic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_traffic)

### **4xx Client Errors - Oops, a Small Mistake**

If I walk into a bare village and ask for a cappuccino or a chicken burrito, they would look at me from head to toe. It's my mistake. I should have asked for their menu before!

Even in cities, we slip to order something that is not on the menu. When that happens, the waiter politely tells you it's not available. This is similar to the "4xx Client Errors" code. It means there's been a little hiccup, but it's usually something you can fix.

### **5xx Server Errors - A Momentary Glitch**

Picture a cosy evening at the restaurant when suddenly the lights flicker due to a power outage. A bad day for the staff, and a good day for the electrician who swiftly fixes it. This is just like the "5xx Server Errors" code. It's a temporary glitch, and the team is on it to get things back to normal ASAP.

This is a general catch-all error when the server side throws an exception.

### Let's memorise some popular moments

**200 OK - The Chef's Visit**

At some point during your meal, the chef pays a visit to your table, asking if everything is perfect. This is exactly what "200 OK" means. It's a sign that everything is fantastic, and you're having a great experience.

**404 Not Found - Off-Menu Items**

You spot something intriguing on the menu, but the waiter kindly informs you that it's not available. Think of this as the '404 Not Found' code. It's like trying to order a dish that's not currently offered on the menu—bummer!

**503 Service Unavailable - A Quick Timeout**

Imagine the restaurant gets super busy, and they briefly stop taking orders to manage the rush. This is like the "503 Service Unavailable" code. It's a timeout to catch their breath and get ready for the next round.

**308 Permanent Redirect - Changing Tables**

Lastly, if you decide to change your dining spot, they provide you with a permanent redirection to the new area. Similarly, "308 Permanent Redirect" helps you find your way to the right place.

### **Conclusion - HTTP Status Codes!**
