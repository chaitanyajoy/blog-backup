Imagine you are in a final interview of your dream Job.

You feel you nailed it.

One hour turned. All of a sudden, a guy came and performed equally, just like you.

You both left the hiring manager in confusion about whom to hire.

What would HR do?

If he is unbiased, he'll look at both of your backgrounds more closely. Trying to search for that one extra tip of trust one might have over the other.

**Certifications are those trust builders** **that can save your life by hopping close calls with your competitors.** **They give that extra edge to you and confidence to others to trust you as a certified professional.**

Now, Are you hunting to find free online course certificates?

If so, I got free, credible, and massive deals to ease your homework.

<div data-node-type="callout">
<div data-node-type="callout-emoji">ðŸ’¡</div>
<div data-node-type="callout-text">Just so you know, most of the free online courses are not genuinely free. In the end, you will have to pay some fee to download the certificate, like Udemy and Coursera. I decided not to consider such to be on this free list. So, whatever you find here is free. <strong>Free means, I mean it.</strong></div>
